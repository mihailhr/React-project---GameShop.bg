# React-project---GameShop.bg


GameShop.bg - a React project created by Mihail Hristov

It is a simple web application, inspired by OLX and Ozone.bg, that allows people to buy and sell games.
Guests can register, log in, check all the games that have been published, the best sellers ranking, as well as the home and about pages.
Registered users can publish their own games and depending on their authorization buy, edit or delete games. They can access all the pages.
Initial setup is being performed for convenience -  it includes the creation of a few user accounts and games.

Initial setup accounts that you can use (Of course you can register as well):
username:"Ivan Stoyanov",password:88888888
username:"Petar1234",password:password
username:"GameShopCreator",password:gameshopPass
username:"Gamer123",password:password2 --- No games uploaded

In later commits the unnecessary  node modules will be deleted.
